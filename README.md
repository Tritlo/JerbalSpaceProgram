JerbalSpaceProgram
==================

A game where you design spaceship parts and spaceships from those parts, and then blast off into space!

This project is a website that runs the game, with a quickstart localplay mode, and then social designing and sharing of parts, with multiplayer capabilities (when flying a shared ship);

This was the final project in both Computer Game Programmingat the University of Iceland. Project members were Matthías Páll Gissurarson, Haukur Óskar Þorgeirsson, Sólrún Halla Einarsdóttir and Bjarki Geir Benediktsson.
