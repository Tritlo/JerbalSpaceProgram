JerbalSpaceProgram
==================

A game where you design spaceship parts and spaceships from those parts, and then blast off into space!

This was the final project in both Computer Game Programming at the University of Iceland. Project members were Matthías Páll Gissurarson, Haukur Óskar Þorgeirsson, Sólrún Halla Einarsdóttir and Bjarki Geir Benediktsson.
